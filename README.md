Project B2 Dev 
Project Description
Develop an e-commerce platform with an integrated inventory management system for a small business. The platform should allow customers to browse products, add them to their cart, and make purchases using fact checking payment methods. The inventory management system should allow the business owner and its partners to add, edit, and remove products from the platform, track stock levels, and receive notifications when inventory is low.

In addition, the platform should have a user management system to allow customers to create accounts, view their order history, and track their current orders. The platform should also have an admin panel that allows the business owner to manage orders, view sales reports, and generate invoices.

To make the platform more engaging, you can implement features such as product recommendations, a search bar, and social media integration. The platform should be developed using a web framework of your choice, and the database should be designed using a relational database management system (RDBMS). Finally, ensure that the platform is secure and can handle high traffic volumes.
